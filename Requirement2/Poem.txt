In shadows deep where whispers play,
A world unseen, by light of day.
A moonlit dance, a silver sea,
A whispered tale, just you and me.

Stars above, like diamonds bright,
Paint the canvas of the night.
Each one a story, a dream untold,
In the vast expanse of cosmic gold.

The nightingale in moonlight sings,
Its melody, on silent wings.
A lullaby for the sleeping earth,
A gentle reminder of its worth.

Mountains high, their silent stance,
Guardians of the night's expanse.
Their ancient wisdom, silent and wise,
Witness to a million skies.

Through the ebon veil, the zephyrs sigh,
A lullaby that paints the sky.
Whispers of a world unknown,
In the night's embrace, we're not alone.

The tapestry of night unfolds,
A story in the stars it holds.
A cosmic ballet, a celestial spree,
A midnight poem for you and me.
